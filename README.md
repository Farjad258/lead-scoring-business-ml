🚀 **Lead Scoring & Sales Prioritization System (Business ML Project)**

🔍 **Business Problem**

Sales teams often waste 50–70% of their time contacting leads that never convert.
This leads to:
	•	Lost productivity
	•	Higher acquisition costs
	•	Missed revenue opportunities

Businesses need a simple, actionable system to prioritize leads most likely to convert.

⸻

✅ **Solution Overview**

This project delivers a Machine Learning-powered Lead Scoring System that:
	•	Predicts the probability of each lead converting
	•	Categorizes leads into High / Medium / Low priority
	•	Produces ready-to-use Excel/CSV outputs for sales teams

No technical setup required — the output is business-ready.

⸻

🧠 **How It Works (Non-Technical)**
	1.	Historical lead data is analyzed
	2.	A Logistic Regression model predicts conversion probability
	3.	Each lead is assigned:
	•	Lead Score (0–1 probability)
	•	Lead Category:
	•	High → Contact immediately
	•	Medium → Nurture / follow-up
	•	Low → Low priority

The goal: maximize revenue, reduce wasted effort.

⸻

🛠 **Tech Stack (Simple, Business-Focused)**
	•	Python
	•	Pandas
	•	Scikit-learn
	•	Logistic Regression
	•	Excel / CSV outputs

Focus is business usability, not complex engineering.

⸻

📊** Output & “Dashboard”**

Instead of over-engineering dashboards, this project provides:
	•	lead_scores.csv — ready for Excel, Google Sheets, or CRM import
	•	Simple Excel visuals:
	•	Lead distribution by High / Medium / Low
	•	Filterable lead table for sales teams

📸 Screenshots included to demonstrate usability.

⸻

💼** Business Impact (ROI)**

Example for a typical sales team:
	•	1,000 leads/month
	•	200 identified as High-probability leads
	•	Converting just 10% of high-quality leads could generate:
	•	£2,000–£5,000 additional monthly revenue
	•	Reduce wasted time on low-value leads


⸻

🏭 Industries That Can Use This
	•	SaaS & Subscription Businesses
	•	B2B Services
	•	Marketing Agencies
	•	Real Estate
	•	FinTech
	•	E-commerce

Any business with leads → immediate impact.

⸻

🚀 How a Business Would Use This
	1.	Upload lead data
	2.	Run the model (or receive lead_scores.csv)
	3.	Open results in Excel
	4.	Sales team contacts High-priority leads first

Done. Business-ready decisions in minutes.

⸻

⭐ Why This Project Stands Out
	•	Business-first: Focus on results, not technical details
	•	Clear ROI: Shows how much revenue can be saved/earned
	•	No complexity: Non-technical teams can use immediately
	•	Sellable: Perfect for freelance clients or LinkedIn showcase
